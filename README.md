excellentHexEditor
==================

tryin to develop a hex editor control for the browser

Just a Javascript and HTML based hex editor running directly in a web browser. Very simple, pretty fast, not using and heavy js libs.

Don't know what it's good for. But maybe you have a usage for it.

IMPORTANT:
This is a pre-alpha: Please keep in mind that it's just a demo of what can it be like. If you like it: join the crew. :-) There's lots of features missing till it's useful.
